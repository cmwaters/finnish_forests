# Make the national parks great again ! MNPGA

A project from the Junction 2019 Helsinki Hackathon. Tourists using regular search engines to find parks and walks to visit often all reach the same conclusion. Because of this Finland suffers from high congestion in some parks and little in others. This project is a combination of an app and a admin dashboard (website) connected through an API to manage parks and influence a better distribution of visitors throughout them.
